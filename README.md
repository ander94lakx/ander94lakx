### What I stand for here?

- I defend free software and open source as methods to share knowledge among all and to guarantee that knowledge is free. 
- I defend the freedom of information and I'm against the privatisation of knowledge.
- I defend hacking as a tool to learn, understand and guarantee the security and privacy of citizens against the violation of rights of any kind.
- I defend the people's right to be and feel in any way, condemning discrimination of any kind, either by sex, gender, race, sexual orientation, religious orientation or any other kind of discrimination.

If you are in favour of privatising knowledge and making it accessible only to those who can afford it, if you think hacking is for criminals or if you discriminate in any way against people, I don't force you, but I kindly invite you to get the fuck out of here.
